				<h3>Biography</h3>
				<p>Jair Gallardo is currently a saxophone student at Northern Arizona University under the instruction of Dr. Johnathan Bergeron. At NAU, Jair performs in various ensembles such as: Jazz Band, Jazz Combo, Wind Symphony, Saxophone Orchestra, Chamber Groups, and a Dixieland Group.
				<br><br>
				In addition to performing in various ensembles at NAU, Jair has played with many professionals in the Phoenix area. He has performed with big bands, funk bands, and small jazz combos.
				<br><br>
				Outside of performing, Jair also likes to compose and arrange for various instrument combinations.
				<br><br>
				He also teaches private saxophone lessons from basics to more advanced music in both jazz and classical music.
				<br><br>
				Jair takes inspiration from a large variety of composers and players such as Chris Potter, Gordon Goodwin, Hanz Zimmer, John Williams, Percy Grainger, Marc Mellits, Jacob TV, Mike Davis, Eric Marienthal, and David Maslanka to name a few.

				<h3>Philosophy</h3>
				Musician nowadays, especially in the big cities, are required do more that just play their instrument. Musicians must know how to not just be a one trick pony.
				<br><br>
				I believe that one should also be capable of doubling on two or more instruments. There have been different situations where I have been asked to play multiple instruments like flute and clarinet. Because I was able to play them, I have been recommended to other musicians. This is important because the chances of getting hired increase the more instruments one can play well. 
				<br><br>
				Musicians should also be well versed in recording themselves or others. This makes one more marketable by having a small recording business on the side. I have been told by other musicians that this is very important skill to have because you will open yourself up to many different musicians that play very different styles.
				<br><br>
				Composing as well as Arranging are very important in the music industry. There will instances where a singer may ask to arrange a big band chart for them based on a recording that they have. Businesses or networks may ask one to compose a jingle of them or compose tunes or pieces for a show or film.</p>
